## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The Variables/coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset were "AWD".
The slope of the linear model is not cosidered to be zero due to the fact that a slope of zero means that the line is horizontal and a horizontal line means you'll get a slope of zero.
The linear model does predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively due to the fact that the residuals give you a breakdown of the linear model and which direction it's heading in.
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The design specifications do dictate that Lot1 and Lot2 would pass the manufacturing data for suspension coils not exceeding 100 pounds per square inch. Lot 3 would not pass because it's over 100 pounds per square inch.
## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
The MechaCar would be of interest to consumers based off of a number of different metrics. You can even throw in whether the area you're selling in is rural/urban which can dictate whether MPG would be a major factor due to the drive of getting resources. Cost would also be a major metric when you throw in how much the average salary of a town/city you're looking to sell in. By doing more research on what type of audience you're trying to sell to you can adjust the factors of MPG, cost, horse power, etc. Creating these extra hypothesis and aquiring more data is what is the key to suceeding in sales.
